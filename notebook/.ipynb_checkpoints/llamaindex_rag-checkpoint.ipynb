      "Q: what is deep singer\n",
      "A:  DeepSinger refers to a multi-lingual multi-singer singing voice synthesis (SVS) system, which is built from scratch using singing training data mined from music websites. The system has a pipeline that includes several steps such as data crawling, singing and accompaniment separation, lyrics-to-singing alignment, data filtration, and singing modeling. DeepSinger directly generates linear spectrograms from lyrics and synthesizes voices using Griffin-Lim. It is designed to avoid human efforts for alignment labeling and greatly reduce labeling cost, as well as to synthesize singing voices in multiple languages and multiple singers. It has been evaluated on a dataset of approximately 92 hours of data from 89 singers across three languages (Chinese, Cantonese, and English). The results indicate that DeepSinger can produce high-quality singing voices in terms of both pitch accuracy and voice naturalness.\n"
